1. Every JavaScript object has a PROTOTYPE PROPERTY, which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript;
2. The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want OTHER OBJECTS TO INHERIT;
3. The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself, it's the prototype of ALL instances 
that are created through it;
4. When a certain method (or property) is called, the serch starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search 
moves on to the object's prototype. This continues until the method is found: PROTOTYPE CHAIN.


FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS
A function is an instance of the Object type;
A function behaves like any other object;
We can store functions in a variable;
We can pass a function as an argument to another function;
We can return a function from a function.

CLOSURES
An inner function has always access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.
